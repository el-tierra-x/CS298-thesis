I greatly appreciate the unwavering help, patience, and priceless critiques of
Professor Dr. Thomas Austin, without which I could never have developed. Thanks to his
supervision, I was able to make strides in my studies over the past two semesters. In
highly effective proposals and discussions, of course, the whiteboard sessions have done
much to polish the presentation project. His willingness to solve all my problems and
steem away suggested approaches for solving prevention procedures myself is all I can
have to be grateful for. My thanks and Highest Regards go also to the Department
of Computer Science at SJSU for first-rate courses and resources that have been
fundamental for achieving the aims of my Projects. My thanks and congratulations
go as well to those faculty and committee members for the numerous insights they
offered. In the end, grateful too for their continued encouragement and assistance
along the way to all my family and friends who helped me out.
